      title: "I fluently navigate between Cantonese, English, and Mandarin, fostering seamless communication across diverse teams. Hands-on experience with various datasets and training tasks has honed my skills in analyzing and preprocessing diverse data sets. My strong foundation in mathematics (algebra, calculus, statistics, and probability) and machine learning architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN, KNN, Transformer, Auto-Encoder, GAN) fuels my expertise in crafting intelligent solutions. I'm also passionate about building user-friendly applications – both mobile and web, with experience in both frontend and backend development. In fact, I led the development of Dr. UST, a multi-function, real-time telemedicine app that won the Best FYP award! My GitHub profile showcases these projects and more, so feel free to explore and get a feel for my technical capabilities.
